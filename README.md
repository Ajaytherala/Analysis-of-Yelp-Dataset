# Dataset

The foundation of this project is the Yelp Dataset, a comprehensive collection of data stored across five JSON files:

1. business
2. tip
3. check-in
4. review
5. user

   
These files collectively contain approximately 9.3 GB of data, providing a rich resource for exploring various aspects of:
